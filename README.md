# Super-School-System
Schools make the foundation of any Child’s development, as they spend most of the time at School. But the day to day activities keeps the school management busy whole day. They lack focusing on individual student’s development level. Teachers also not get dedicated 100% to students because they also play a major role in the school academic &amp; administration work.
